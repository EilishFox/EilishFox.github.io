I noticed that my dog wanted to look out the window but she knew she wasn’t allowed on the couch. Stairs would be the perfect solution. I looked for a set of stairs but none met my requirements. So, I made my own. I wanted this to replace her crate (that we never closed), give her access to the window, and have storage.

I gathered my measurements: the total height, width, and length; the angle for the stair side; & the rise and run for the steps.

I chose MDF for the sides because it is sturdy and cheap. I chose the wood for similar reasons plus it looks nice. 

I could only find large pieces of MDF and wood. I used a handsaw to cut the pieces to size. 

Initially, I was going to use nails as fasteners. That proved quite difficult. I switched to screws and rented a drill. That was SO much easier, more precise, and faster. I also used wood glue in the joints. The hinges attached to the top step and the platform worked wonderfully to allow for storage.

Once everything was put together, I placed it under the window. It was the perfect size.

I had three issues:
1. I did need to place a brace (leftover MDF) under the middle step for support. For the first time making stairs, I think they were pretty grand.
2. The slight accuracy in measurements, available materials, and my hand sawing led to the platform to not be flush with the edge of the MDF. It wasn’t a big enough problem to fix. Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t buy matching wood with the right dimensions.
3. Maebh (my dog) didn’t like the steps. They were too slick and she slipped while using them. The solution was quite simple: felt. She needed traction and gluing down some felt did the trick.

The completed build worked wonderfully. Maebh used it daily and I could sit up there with her.
