These two originate from thinking of a birthday gift for my sister. 
I asked her what her favorite dinosaur was and she said Troodons, specifically Alaskan Troodons, because they would start fires. I came up with the idea of creating an embroidery of a Troodon holding a lit match. 

I first attempted to draw the dino using Microsoft Paint but the mouse movement did not translate very well. I then tried to generate an AI image but I could not get any to produce anything close to what I wanted - they couldn’t give me a simple Troodon.
I then attempted to sketch my idea using traditional paper and pencil. I liked where I got to but did not feel confident to draw the details.

The second dinosaur was an idea that came to me after I had little luck with the Troodon. I thought a simpler cute dino would be something I could do. I sketched out what I imagined, a triceratops but its horns are ice cream cones with the three flavors of spumoni - the Spumoni-tops (inspired by Moriah Elizabeth’s artwork). 
I liked my sketch but I still didn’t have the tools to make what I wanted.

I waited until I was visiting family, for my brother’s graduation, to use my brother’s iPad. I used ProCreate to create these two dinos. I used reference photos, found on Google, for both dinosaurs.

I’d still like to make the Troodon as an embroidery piece and to paint the Spumoni-tops.
