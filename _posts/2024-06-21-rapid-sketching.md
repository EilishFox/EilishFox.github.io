During a course in the Google UX Design Certificate, I learned about the practice of rapid sketching (or crazy eights). The course prompted me to try it with a “How might we…?” question.

I remembered when I wanted a better way to keep my dog from getting so wet when walking her in the rain. As a corgi, she was low enough to the ground that the flicks of water and dirt that came off her paws went onto her stomach. I could not find a single dog raincoat that would cover enough of her chest/belly to mitigate my problem.

So, I thought I’d do my rapid sketching with the question of “How might we keep dogs dry in the rain?” And this is my result of the exercise.
