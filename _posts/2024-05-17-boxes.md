I have many craft/art supplies but they donâ€™t store very well on these shelves.

I saw this video on YouTube, which inspired me to make boxes for these supplies.

I had a cardboard box that I used to create two boxes of custom sizes. 
I bought some rope, ribbon, fabric, and many hot glue sticks.

I chose the beige fabric for the insides due to how well it matched the color of the ribbon.

One thing that bothered me about the first box I completed (the smaller one) was the amount of cardboard that is visible at the handhold. So, when I made the second I painted the cardboard around the holes and did my best to splay and flatten the ropes around the edges. 
It took me a couple weeks - plus a few burns - to finish them and I am pleased with the result.

My supplies are better organized and are no longer an eyesore. 

Completed on March 5th, 2024.
