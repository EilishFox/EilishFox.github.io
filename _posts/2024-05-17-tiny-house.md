I was gifted a hot glue gun for my birthday (in 2021). As I thought about what I could use it for, an excess amount of cardboard boxes were begging to be used. 

I came up with the idea of building a miniature house - complete with furniture. 

I drew up some designs.

I made as much as I could from materials I had already. I only purchased the paint, mod podge, clay, the scrapbook papers, and superglue.

The couch was made from cardboard, chopsticks (from food deliveries), old pajama pants, and wool.

The books were made from cardboard.

The bed was made from cardboard, an old shirt, and wool.

The tablecloth was made from the lining from an old, ripped jacket.

The door accessories, sinks, bathtub, and toilet were made from clay.

The shower curtain is made from a plastic bag and the rod is a paperclip.
I designed the rugs and used aida (cross stitch) fabric, embroidery floss, and superglue.

The scale of things is not great; particularly, with the stair railing height and toilet size.

This is yet to be completed.
