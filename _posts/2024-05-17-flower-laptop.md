In my college introductory art class, we were assigned to “transform” an object. We had to entirely cover an object with different objects. I had a few ideas but this one was my favorite. 

I had an old laptop that no longer functioned, that I was holding on to in order to recycle it. I thought it would be fun to cover that laptop with flowers. 

I bought some fake flowers to cover the laptop. I took apart the flowers to use leaves, petals, and flower heads individually. I merged some flower heads together to make fuller blooms.

Using hot glue, I covered the laptop with flowers. I didn’t have a set plan for where each piece would go, I placed them as I went. However, I did place the blue flowers where the screen is to suggest what it is underneath. I was able to maintain the hinging ability of the laptop.

I am very pleased with the final product. I like how it can symbolize how resilient plantlife can be - plants can overtake unused technology. Also, I just really like the way the flowers look.
